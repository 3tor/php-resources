CMS (content management system) is an application and unlike a framework it
provides you higher level developed architecture for working with content -
publishing, editing, organizing and deleting. Simple difference between framework
and CMS is that CMS is built with framework.

There are many open source CMSes built with PHP, that might be worth picking for
your project since they speed up the project delivery and they have large
communities behind them which can help you a lot.

Which CMS is right for your project, is quite honestly impossible to answer in
general. You must know the benefits and limitations of them before creating a
project.
