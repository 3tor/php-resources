## What is nopaste service?

Term *nopaste* is used on internet and means to paste source code on separate
dedicated site and use that link in forum discussion or chat instead of pasting
the source code directly in the message. Many forums and chat rooms don't have
option of treating code in messages properly. Nopaste sites usually offer also
syntax highlighting and history of code changes, commenting on lines of code and
similar.
