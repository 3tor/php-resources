An abstract class is one that cannot be instantiated, only inherited. It is declared
with the keyword `abstract`:

```php
<?php

abstract class MyAbstractClass
{
    abstract function myAbstractFunction() {}
}
```

When inheriting from an abstract class, all methods marked abstract in the
parent's class declaration must be defined by the child; additionally, these
methods must be defined with the same visibility.

Note that function definitions inside an abstract class must also be preceded by
the keyword `abstract`. It is not legal to have abstract function definitions
inside a non-abstract class.
