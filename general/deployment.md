Deployment of web application is a process where application is uploaded from the
source code repository (Git) or development machine to a web server to make it
accessible over the HTTP.

During deployment, source code files are transfered, web assets (JavaScript, CSS,
images) are generated, minified and/or concatenated, database migrations are run,
cache is cleared, web server gets restarted and similar.

Deploying PHP application to production or staging environment might not be so
obvious task.

* GIT + SSH

## FTP

The simplest way of uploading files to a web server is by using FTP with FTP
client such as [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/). FTP is simple and
convenient, but doesn't provide much more options. Also security is very reduced.

## GIT + SSH

When working with Git and have SSH access available other more advanced approaches
are recommended.
